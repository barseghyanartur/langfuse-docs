# Phoenix Arize Alternatives? Langfuse vs. Phoenix Arize

This article compares [Phoenix Arize](https://docs.arize.com/phoenix) and [Langfuse](https://www.langfuse.com), two **open source** LLM observability platforms.

## High Level Comparison

Phoenix Arize and Langfuse are both open-source tools for LLM observability, analytics, evaluation, testing, and annotation. However, they differ in focus areas, adoption, and suitability for different stages of LLM application development.

- **Use For:**
  - **Phoenix Arize**: Focused on the experimental and development stages of LLM applications. It provides tools for evaluation and troubleshooting within a notebook-centric workflow. However, it **lacks prompt management** and **comprehensive LLM usage monitoring** features, which may limit its effectiveness in production environments.
  - **Langfuse**: Best in class for core LLM engineering features (tracing, evaluations, prompt management, and open, stable APIs), prompt management, and usage analytics for LLM applications.

- **Adoption and Production Readiness**: Langfuse has a larger open source adoption compared to Phoenix Arize and is considered battle-tested for production use cases. This makes Langfuse an good choice for companies seeking a reliable tool for live production environments.

- **Integration with Arize**: Phoenix Arize is a good solution if your company already uses [Arize AI's](https://arize.com) enterprise platform. Phoenix works hand-in-hand with Arize, ensuring a smooth data transfer between the two tools.

- **Self-Hosting**: Langfuse offers extensive [self-hosting documentation](/docs/deployment/feature-overview) for data security or compliance requirements.
