# Phoenix Arize Alternative? Langfuse vs. Phoenix LLM Observability

This article compares [Phoenix Arize](https://docs.arize.com/phoenix) and [Langfuse](https://www.langfuse.com), two **open source** LLM observability platforms.

## High Level Comparison

Phoenix Arize and Langfuse are both open-source tools for LLM observability, analytics, evaluation, testing, and annotation. However, they differ in focus, adoption, and suitability for different stages of LLM application development.

- **Focus**: 
  - Langfuse focuses on being **best in class** for core LLM engineering features (tracing, evaluations, prompt management, APIs), prompt management, and usage analytics.
  - Phoenix Arize focuses on the **experimental and development** stages of LLM apps.

- **Self-Hosting**: Langfuse is very easy to self-host and offers extensive [self-hosting documentation](/docs/deployment/feature-overview) for data security or compliance requirements.

- **Integration with Arize**: Phoenix Arize is a good solution if your company already uses [Arize AI's](https://arize.com) platform. Phoenix enables a smooth data transfer between the two tools. However, it lacks **prompt management** and **LLM usage monitoring** features, which may limit its effectiveness in production environments.

- **Adoption and Production Readiness**: Langfuse has a larger open source adoption compared to Phoenix Arize and is considered [battle-tested](https://www.thoughtworks.com/en-de/radar/platforms/langfuse) for production use cases. This makes Langfuse a good choice for companies seeking a reliable tool for live production environments.

### What is Langfuse?

Langfuse is an LLM observability platform that provides a comprehensive tracing and logging solution for LLM applications. Langfuse helps teams to understand and debug complex LLM applications and evaluate and iterate them in production.

### What is Langfuse used for?

- **Holistic Tracing and Debugging**: Effective tracking of both LLM and non-LLM actions, delivering complete context for applications.
- **Production Environments**: Best in class for core LLM engineering features, emphasizing production-grade monitoring, debugging, and performance analytics.
- **Prompt Management**: Provides robust [prompt management](/docs/prompt-management) solutions through client SDKs, ensuring minimal impact on application latency and uptime during prompt retrieval.
- **Integration Options**: Supports asynchronous logging and tracing SDKs with integrations for frameworks like [LangChain](/docs/integrations/langchain/tracing), [LlamaIndex](/docs/integrations/llama-index/get-started), [OpenAI SDK](/docs/integrations/openai/python/get-started), and [others](/docs/integrations/overview).
- **Deep Evaluation**: Facilitates user feedback collection, manual reviews, annotation queues, automated annotations, and [custom evaluation](/docs/scores/overview) functions.
- **Self-Hosting**: Extensive [self-hosting documentation](/docs/deployment/feature-overview) for data security or compliance requirements.
